To **analyze the temporal trend and seasonal variation** of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)

    """
This section visualizes the **temporal behavior** of HFMD cases across Malaysia using daily and monthly time-series data.  
The analysis highlights **cyclical outbreak trends**, often peaking during **warmer and wetter months**.  
By examining line and heatmap plots, we can identify **consistent seasonal surges** (typically mid-year) and observe 
long-term fluctuations over the decade. These insights support early-warning efforts and public health planning 
to mitigate seasonal HFMD epidemics in Malaysia.

The visualizations reveal **recurring seasonal peaks** of HFMD cases‚Äîcommonly between **May and August**,

Line plots demonstrate a **cyclical annual rise and fall**, while the heatmap confirms mid-year clustering across multiple years.  
These findings suggest a strong **seasonal dependency** of HFMD transmission dynamics, emphasizing the need for  
targeted health interventions and community awareness campaigns before anticipated outbreak periods.
